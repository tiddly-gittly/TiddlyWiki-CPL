Background\n\n[[google/zx|https://github.com/google/zx]] is a tool for writing better scripts, with Javascript.\n\nThis tiddlywiki plugin enables you to run any tiddler with zx.\n\n!! Basic Usage\n\n!!! Prerequisit\n\nThis plugin requires [TidGi](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/TidGi-Desktop) Desktop App environment to function properly. It will send tiddler content to the `zx` inside TidGi, and prints the output.\n\n!!! Tiddler Type\n\nTiddler with title extension `*.js *.md *.mjs` can be execute without problem. Other tiddler witout extension (no `.xxx`) will be executed as `*.md` file, for example, tid file without extions will be executed as `*.md`, but it works without problem too, even you are writing wiki text instead of markdown.\n\nIf you add filetype `application/javascript` to your tiddler, it will be recognized as `*.mjs`.\n\n!!! Button\n\nA ViewToolbar button is added. You can click on it to execute the script inside your tiddler.\n\nAnd the zx output will be printed below your tiddler content.\n\n!!! Demo\n\n```js\nconsole.log(`!! Hi!`);\n```\n\nSee [[$:/plugins/linonetwo/zx-script/demo]] for demo of full tiddler execution.\n\n!! Wiki Scripting\n\n!!! Execute the code block on the $tw context\n\nYou can write some code that is surrounded with `/** tw */` separator. They will be recognized as js code and executed on the context that have access to the $tw api.\n\nGlobal variables you can use:\n\n* `$tw` try it in your [[developer tool|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools]] to play around!\n* `_` [[lodash|https://lodash.com/docs/]]\n\nThis means you can fetch some data on the zx script, and write the results to the wiki, creating new tiddlers.\n\n!!! Access filter and macros\n\nFilter function's call example is\n\n```js\n/** tw */\nconst result = $tw.wiki.filterOperators.sum((callback) => {callback({}, '2');callback({}, '2')})\nconsole.log(result)\n```\n\n!!
