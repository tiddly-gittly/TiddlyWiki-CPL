Refnotes can create bibliography, but for the best performance, and to use import bibtex entries, the use of the official ''bibtex importer'' plugin is required. APA7 style is used as default. Refnotes output is very close to APA7 standard.\n\n;Code and demo\nFor learning Refnotes features, syntax, tutorial and examples see the plugin demo and code pages\n\n* Demo: https://kookma.github.io/TW-Refnotes/\n* Code: https://github.com/kookma/TW-Refnotes\n","version":"1.9.1","plugin-type":"plugin","core-version":">=5.2.5","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"1.9.1","versions":["1.8.7","1.9.0","1.9.1"],"versions-size":{"1.8.7":57599,"1.9.0":57599,"1.9.1":57753}}
