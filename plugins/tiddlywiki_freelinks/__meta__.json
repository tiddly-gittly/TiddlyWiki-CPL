Notes\n\nTo change within which tiddlers freelinking occurs requires customising the shadow tiddler [[$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/freelinks/macros/view]]. This tiddler is tagged $:/tags/Macro/View  which means that it will be included as a local macro in each view template. By default, its content is:\n\n```\n<$set name=\"tv-freelinks\" value={{$:/config/Freelinks/Enable}}/>\n```\n\nThat means that for each tiddler the variable tv-freelinks will be set to the tiddler $:/config/Freelinks/Enable, which is set to \"yes\" or \"no\" by the settings in control panel.\n\nInstead, we can use a filter expression to, say, only freelink within the tiddler with the title \"HelloThere\":\n\n```\n<$set name=\"tv-freelinks\" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>match[HelloThere]then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>\n```\n\nOr, we can make a filter that will only freelink within tiddlers with the tag \"MyTag\":\n\n```\n<$set name=\"tv-freelinks\" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>tag[MyTags]then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>\n```\n\nOr we can combine both approaches:\n\n```\n<$set name=\"tv-freelinks\" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>match[HelloThere]] ~[<currentTiddler>tag[MyTag]] +[then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>\n```\n","version":"5.3.7","plugin-type":"plugin","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"5.3.7","versions":["5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4","5.3.5","5.3.6","5.3.7"],"versions-size":{"5.3.1":12441,"5.3.2":12441,"5.3.3":12441,"5.3.4":12474,"5.3.5":12474,"5.3.6":12546,"5.3.7":12364}}
