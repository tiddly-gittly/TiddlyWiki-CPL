It adds a button to page controls, on click, creates a tiddler tagged with `solution`, contains `keywords`, `responder`, and `url` fields. It then uses a view template to show the `responder` (author), reference post (`url`), and the `keywords` in a semantic way.\n\nThe `keywords` field acts like tags, so, clicking on them shows a list of all tiddlers tagged with this keyword or has this keyword in its `keywords` field.\n\n; Code and demo\nFor learning plugin features, syntax, tutorial and examples see the plugin demo and code pages\n\n* Demo: https://kookma.github.io/TW-Solution/\n* Code: https://github.com/kookma/TW-Solution\n","version":"1.4.2","plugin-type":"plugin","core-version":">=5.1.21","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"1.4.2","versions":["1.4","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.4.1","1.4.2"],"versions-size":{"1.2.0":8028,"1.3.0":8585,"1.4.1":13245,"1.4.2":13304,"1.4":13180}}
