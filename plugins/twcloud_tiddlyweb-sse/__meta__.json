It adds a route to the server which sends server-sent events to the client, and loads an `EventSource` in the client to call `$tw.syncer.syncFromServer()`.\n\nThe plugin may be quickly included in a wiki by adding `\"++C:\\path\\to\\tiddlyweb-sse\\dist\"` //before// the data folder.\n\n```bash\nnode tiddlywiki.js \"++C:\\path\\to\\tiddlyweb-sse\\dist\" \"C:\\my\\datafolder\" --listen\n```\n\nIt may also be included in the data folder by putting either the //contents// of the dist folder or the single `plugin.info` bundle (available from the releases page) in the folder `plugins/tiddlyweb-sse`.\n\nhttps://github.com/twcloud/tiddlyweb-sse/releases\n\nThis also works properly with [TiddlyServer][1], although it still requires adding the plugin to each individual data folder. If you want a way to specify plugins besides those in core in the tiddlywiki.info file, you can use [environment variables][2] to tell TiddlyWiki where else to look for these.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/Arlen22/TiddlyServer\n\n[2]: https://tiddlywiki.com/#Environment%20Variables%20on%20Node.js\n","version":"1.0.3","plugin-type":"plugin","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"1.0.3","versions":["1.0.3"],"versions-size":{"1.0.3":316}}
