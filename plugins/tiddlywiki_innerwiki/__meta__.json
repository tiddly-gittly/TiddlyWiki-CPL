Introduction\n\nThis plugin enables TiddlyWiki to embed a modified copy of itself (an \"innerwiki\") with overlaid graphics. The primary motivation is to be able to produce screenshot illustrations that are automatically up-to-date with the appearance of TiddlyWiki as it changes over time, or to produce the same screenshot in different languages.\n\nIn the browser, innerwikis are displayed as an embedded iframe. Under Node.js [[Google's Puppeteer|https://pptr.dev/]] is used to load the innerwikis as off-screen web pages and then snapshot them as a PNG image.\n\n!! Warnings\n\nThe `<$innerwiki>` widget is relatively slow and resource intensive: each time it is refreshed it will entirely rebuild the iframe containing the innerwiki.\n\nThe `<$innerwiki>` widget does not automatically resize with its container (for example, try hiding the sidebar in this wiki).\n\n!! Prequisites\n\nIn order to take screenshots under Node.js, Google Puppeteer must first be installed from [[npm|https://npmjs.org//]]. For most situations, it should be installed at the root of the TiddlyWiki 5 repo:\n\n```\ncd Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5\nnpm install puppeteer\n```\n\nHowever, if you're working in a different repo that uses npm to install TiddlyWiki 5 then you should install Puppeteer into the same repo. The general rule is that the `node_modules` folder containing Puppeteer should be contained within an ancestor of the folder containing TiddlyWiki's `tiddlywiki.js` file.\n\n","version":"5.3.5","plugin-type":"plugin","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"5.3.5","versions":["5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4","5.3.5"],"versions-size":{"5.3.1":37892,"5.3.2":37892,"5.3.3":37892,"5.3.4":35106,"5.3.5":35106}}
