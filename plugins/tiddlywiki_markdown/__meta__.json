Compatibility Notes\n\n* <p>A tab character in Markdown has a size of four spaces. Configure the tab size of your code editor accordingly. For example, if you use <$text text=\"CodeMirror\"/>, it is recommended that you set $:/config/codemirror/indentUnit and $:/config/codemirror/tabSize to `4` to avoid inconsistent indentations.</p>\n* <p>HTML blocks are ultimately parsed by the <$text text=WikiText/> parser: //an opening tag followed by a blank line will activate block-level parsing for its content//. When working with tags designed to contain literal content, such as `<pre>` and `<style>` tags, refrain from adding blank lines after the opening tags.</p>\n* <p>You must terminate a table with either a blank line or another block-level structure.</p>\n* <p>`latex-parser` in $:/config/markdown/renderWikiTextPragma is no longer required and will be ignored.</p>\n* <p>Config option `linkNewWindow` is removed.</p>\n\n!! Extending the Parser\n\nYou can extend the parser by loading additional markdown-it plugins this way:\n\n```js\nvar plugin1 = require(...);\nvar plugin2 = require(...);\n\nvar md = $tw.Wiki.parsers[\"text/markdown\"].prototype.md;\n\nmd.use(plugin1)\n  .use(plugin2, opts, ...);\n```","version":"5.3.4","plugin-type":"plugin","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"5.3.4","versions":["5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4"],"versions-size":{"5.3.1":219113,"5.3.2":219113,"5.3.3":219113,"5.3.4":219146}}
