What is this?\n\nThis is a plugin for ~TiddlyWiki that lets you export tiddlers to Markdown.\n\n!! Wait, //which// Markdown?\n\nThere are quite a few different Markdown specifications, and I have settled on [[Pandoc Markdown|https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown]], for two reasons:\n\n# Pandoc Markdown is quite capable, with a lot of extensions. All of these extensions will not work in every Markdown renderer, but most will.\n# [[Pandoc|https://pandoc.org]] itself is a great way to convert from (Pandoc) Markdown to other document formats, such as Word or PDF.\n\n!!! Further conversion with Pandoc\n\nYou can convert a Markdown file to Word with this simple Pandoc command:\n\n```\npandoc -o output.docx input.md\n```\n\nSimply change \".docx\" to \".html\" or \".pdf\" to convert to other formats, or use [[the --to switch|https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--to]].\n\nYou can also convert this Pandoc Markdown file to CommonMark or GitHub-Flavored Markdown like this:\n\n```\npandoc -o common.md --to commonmark input.md\npandoc -o github.md --to gfm input.md\n```\n\n!! Some caveats\n\nSince ~TiddlyWiki is very expressive -- and has a multitude of plugins -- export plugins such as this probably cannot support all possible variations.\n\nConverting to Markdown requires a bunch of compromises, and will therefore be \"opinionated\". This is how //I// want my Markdown to look.\n\n!! How it works\n\nThere are two tiddlers involved:\n\n* [[$:/plugins/cdaven/markdown-export/MenuItem]] adds an option to the Export Tiddler dropdown menu.\n* [[$:/plugins/cdaven/markdown-export/markdown-export.js]] defines the Javascript macro `markdown-export`.\n\n!! Technical Details\n\nThe plugin is written in Typescript, and transpiled to Javascript for modern browsers. It will not work in Internet Explorer, but most modern browsers //should// work.\n\n!!
