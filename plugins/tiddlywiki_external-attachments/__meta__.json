Introduction\n\nThis plugin provides support for importing tiddlers as external attachments. That means that instead of importing binary files as self-contained tiddlers, they are imported as \"skinny\" tiddlers that reference the original file via the ''_canonical_uri'' field. This reduces the size of the wiki and thus improves performance. However, it does mean that the wiki is no longer fully self-contained.\n\n! Compatibility\n\nThis plugin only works when using TiddlyWiki with platforms such as TiddlyDesktop that support the ''path'' attribute for imported/dragged files.\n\n","version":"5.3.8","plugin-type":"plugin","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"5.3.8","versions":["5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4","5.3.5","5.3.6","5.3.7","5.3.8"],"versions-size":{"5.3.1":9890,"5.3.2":9890,"5.3.3":9890,"5.3.4":9923,"5.3.5":9923,"5.3.6":10006,"5.3.7":9912,"5.3.8":9912}}
