Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the objects lack legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form. \\n\\nIf you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determine by its size.

Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the spere moves with you, centered on you. \\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. \\n\\nTargeted Effects. \\nSpells and other magical effects, such as magic missle and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. \\n\\nAreas of Magic. \\nThe area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. \\n\\nSpells. \\n&nbsp;Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. \\n\\nMagic Items. \\nThe properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. Forexample, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (For example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be supressed as soon as it exits. \\n\\nMagical Travel. \\nTeleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spells, temporarily closes while in the sphere. \\n\\nCreatures and Objects. \\nA creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer withinthe sphere. \\n\\nDispel Magic. \\nSpells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t nullify each other.\"},\"Antipathy/Sympathy\":{\"title\":\"Antipathy/Sympathy\",\"at_higher_level\":\"\",\"casting_time\":\"1 Hour\",\"classes\":\"[[Druid]] [[Wizard]]\",\"components\":\"V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect)\",\"concentration\":\"No\",\"duration\":\"10 days\",\"level\":\"8\",\"range\":\"60 feet\",\"ritual\":\"No\",\"school\":\"Enchantment\",\"type\":\"Spell\",\"text\":\"This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. \\nYou target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube.

The creature remains frightened while it can&nbsp;see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened&nbsp;by the target, the creature must use its movement to&nbsp;move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see&nbsp;the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from&nbsp;the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer&nbsp;frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if&nbsp;it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.&nbsp;\\n\\nSympathy. \\nThe enchantment causes the specified&nbsp;creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target&nbsp;while within 60 feet of it or able to see it.

In addition, a creature affected by&nbsp;the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every&nbsp;24 hours while the spell persists.&nbsp;\\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect&nbsp;is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be&nbsp;affected again.\"},\"Arcane Eye\":{\"title\":\"Arcane Eye\",\"at_higher_level\":\"\",\"casting_time\":\"1 Action\",\"classes\":\"[[Wizard]]\",\"components\":\"V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)\",\"concentration\":\"Yes\",\"duration\":\"Concentration, up to 1 hour\",\"level\":\"4\",\"range\":\"30 feet\",\"ritual\":\"No\",\"school\":\"Divination\",\"type\":\"Spell\",\"text\":\"You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration. \\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.
