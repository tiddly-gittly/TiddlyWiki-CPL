Introduction\n\nThis plugin provides support for importing tiddlers as external attachments. That means that instead of importing binary files as self-contained tiddlers, they are imported as \"skinny\" tiddlers that reference the original file via the ''_canonical_uri'' field. This reduces the size of the wiki and thus improves performance. However, it does mean that the wiki is no longer fully self-contained.\n\n! Compatibility\n\nThis plugin only works when using TiddlyWiki with platforms such as TiddlyDesktop/TidGi Desktop that support the ''path'' attribute for imported/dragged files (provided by app). And also need the app supports `file://` protocol of link.","version":"1.2.1","plugin-type":"plugin","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"1.2.1","versions":["1.1.1","1.2.0","1.2.1"],"versions-size":{"1.1.1":16212,"1.2.0":16876,"1.2.1":16857}}
