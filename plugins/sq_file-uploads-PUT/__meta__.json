Saves to ~WebDav or other servers accepting PUT requests.\n\nCurrently the uploader derives the base URL for the ~WebDav server from the URL of the document. This fits the use case of using a ~WebDav (or other PUT enabled server) used to host a ~TiddlyWiki that can be saved.\n\nFor a lightweight and easy solution for hosting a local ~TiddlyWiki using ~WebDav see this [[discussion|https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/use-webdav-for-saving-a-single-file-wiki/441]].","version":"0.1.2","plugin-type":"plugin","parent-plugin":"$:/plugins/commons/file-uploads","core-version":">=5.1.23","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"0.1.2","versions":["0.1.2"],"versions-size":{"0.1.2":6547}}
