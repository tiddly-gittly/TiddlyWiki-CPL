{"title":"$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/savetrail","author":"tiddlywiki","name":"Save Trail","description":"Automatically download modified tiddlers","readme":"This plugin causes TiddlyWiki to continuously download (as a JSON file) the contents of any tiddler that is manually changed by any of several means:\n\n* Confirming an edit\n* Deleting tiddlers\n* Imports\n* Renames/relinks\n* Optionally, typing in draft tiddlers can trigger a download\n\nWhere appropriate, separate 'before' and 'after' files are downloaded. Configured correctly, the browser will download the files silently in the background, and they can be used as a backup in case of accidental data loss.\n\n''CAUTION'': Using this plugin will generate a //lot// of files in your downloads folder! Some points to watch:\n\n* This plugin is pretty much unusable unless your browser is set up to download files automatically, without prompting for the location\n* Automatic file downloading doesn't work in all browsers - in particular, Safari and Internet Explorer do not currently support the [[necessary HTML5 feature|http://caniuse.com/download]]\n* Be aware of the privacy implications of leaving a plaintext trail of all of your edits. You should only enable this plugin on computers that your trust and with content that is not sensitive\n* The plugin uses the tiddler title plus a timestamp to generate a filename for the downloaded file, but some browsers ignore the specified title and generate their own title for each downloaded file\n\nOther points to note:\n\n* By default, after a draft tiddler has been modified the plugin waits until at least one second has elapsed since the last typing before it attempts to download the tiddler. This reduces the number of times that rapidly changing tiddlers are saved\n* This plugin can be used with both the single file HTML configuration and under Node.js because it is independent of the usual saving and syncing processes\n","version":"5.3.4","plugin-type":"plugin","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"5.3.4","versions":["5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4"],"versions-size":{"5.3.1":9038,"5.3.2":9038,"5.3.3":9038,"5.3.4":9071}}
