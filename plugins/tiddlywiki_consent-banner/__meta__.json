{"title":"$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/consent-banner","author":"tiddlywiki","name":"Consent Banner","description":"Consent banner for GDPR etc","readme":"The ''consent-banner'' plugin helps make websites that are compliant with \"cookie legislation\" such as the [[EU General Data Protection Regulation|https://gdpr.eu/cookies/]].\nIt presents a banner inviting the user to accept or reject cookies, keeping track of their consent in local storage so that the banner can be hidden on subsequent visits.\n\nBy default, content embedded with &lt;iframe>, &lt;embed> and &lt;object> is blocked unless the user consents to accept cookies.\n\nConsent status is  available via a configuration tiddler so that it is possible to construct content that behaves differently depending upon whether consent has been granted. As an example, a macro is provided for embedding ~YouTube videos that automatically uses the youtube-nocookie.com variant of video URLs unless the user has accepted cookies.\n\nPlease note that using this plugin does not guarantee compliance with any particular legislation. You will need to understand the technical issues specific to your situation, and if necessary seek legal advice.\n","version":"5.3.5","plugin-type":"plugin","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"5.3.5","versions":["5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4","5.3.5"],"versions-size":{"5.3.1":28387,"5.3.2":28387,"5.3.3":28387,"5.3.4":28420,"5.3.5":28420}}
