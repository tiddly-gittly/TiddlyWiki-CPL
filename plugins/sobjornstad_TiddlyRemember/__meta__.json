TiddlyRemember can take you right back to your notes.\n* If you already have notes on a topic, this can help keep your content more [[DRY|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself]] -- you don't have to maintain the same knowledge in two places. If your knowledge on a topic changes and you update your notes or flashcards, they won't get out of sync.\n* You can easily add notes to your Anki collection at the same time you're taking narrative or outline notes, without having to switch back and forth between two applications.\n\nYou can write [[Question-and-answer notes]]:\n\n```\n<<rememberq \"20200523175149066\"\n\t\"What tool does TiddlyRemember integrate TiddlyWiki with?\"\n\t\"Anki.\">>\n```\n\nOr you can use [[Cloze notes]]:\n\n```\n<<remembercz \"20200523175253647\"\n\t\"TiddlyRemember integrates TiddlyWiki with {Anki}.\">>\n```\n\nReady to get started?\n\n```\n<<tabs\n    tabsList:\"[tag<currentTiddler>]\"\n    default:\"Installing TiddlyRemember\"\n\tstate:\"$:/temp/TrTabState\"\n    class:\"tc-vertical\"\n    template:\"$:/sib/TabCurrentTemplate\">>\n```","version":"1.3.6","plugin-type":"plugin","core-version":">=5.1.21","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"1.3.6","versions":["1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6"],"versions-size":{"1.3.4":17858,"1.3.5":17858,"1.3.6":17858}}
