It currently works directly with XHTML documents and with Microsoft Word compatible DOCX documents via conversion to HTML.\n\nIt is an expression of the philosophy of TiddlyWiki: that text is easier to re-use and work with if it is sliced up into separate chunks that can be independently manipulated, and then woven back together to make up stories and narratives for publication.\n\n",
