Note that it is recommended to leave the consistency check on. This helps avoid concurrent writes such as happens when the same wiki is open in separate tabs.\n\nAllowing `IndexedDB` usage when the wiki is loaded from `file://` instead of a webserver is a potential security issue. Chromium based browsers consider every page from `file://` to be the same origin. This means if you open an untrusted html file, it could read/write to your wiki file. Note that this requires you to explicitly download the html page and then open it from your file system. Merely going to a webpage served via http(s) is not enough to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nIt is recommended to backup the location where you store your wiki regularly. However, the single file with versioned backup saver style saves each version of your wiki under /{selected folder}/backups/{wiki filename/{version hash}.html."
