        "cpl.readme": "; Todolist\nTodolist is a small pure wikitext plugin, for creating todo lists and interstitial journaling. Todolist gives you the confidence that everything’s organized and accounted for, so you can make progress on the things that are important to you.\n\nYou can also make to-dos for major tasks like a project, a work assignment or an overall goal. Therefore, the overall purpose of creating a to-do is to remember tasks and prioritize them.\n\n//Interstitial journaling// is a productivity technique created by Tony Stubblebine. It’s the simplest way to combine note-taking, tasks, and time tracking in one unique workflow (See [[NessLabs|https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling]]).\n\n;Code and demo\nFor learning plugin features, syntax, tutorial and examples see the plugin demo and code pages\n\n* Demo: https://kookma.github.io/TW-Todolist/\n* Code: https://github.com/kookma/TW-Todolist\n",
