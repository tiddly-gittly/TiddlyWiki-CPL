        "cpl.readme": "This plugin provides a simple means for adding threaded comments to tiddlers.\n\n* Click the \"add comment\" button to make a new comment, and then click the \"save\" button to save it\n* You can comment on a tiddler itself, or add a comment to an existing comment\n* The sidebar tab ''Comments'' lists a timeline of all comments\n* Comments are attributed to the username stored in the system tiddler [[$:/status/UserName]]\n* By default, comments are available on all non-system tiddlers. The ''config'' tab lets you customise which tiddlers can accept comments by specifying a filter extension\n* The buttons for adding and editing comments are only available if the system tiddler [[$:/status/IsReadOnly]] is not set to `yes`\n* Use the \"All comments\" option in the $:/AdvancedSearch ''Filter'' tab to see or export all comments\n\n!! Data Model\n\nThe data model employed by the comments plugin is very simple:\n\n* Comment tiddlers are identified by the `role` field being set to `comment`\n* The `list` field of comment tiddlers lists the tiddlers to which this comment applies\n** It is thus possible for a comment to be applied to multiple tiddlers at once\n** The links between comments can be preserved when renaming them by using the relink checkbox in the edit template\n* The `edit-mode` field of comment tiddlers is set to `yes` to display it in edit mode, or `no` to display it in view mode\n* The `saved-text` field is updated when switching to edit mode so that it can be restored if the user cancels\n\n",
